The reason why I chose MIT License was because that it is a short and simple persissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices.
For this assignment, I don't really care that people use what I got here.  In addition, this is totally free of charge.
When we create a project, even in cases where data has been made available as a public domain dedication without conditions on reuse, an explicit statement is required together with the data to provide users with legal clarity.
Without a licence, what we created is not really open.
A licence tells anyone that they can access, use and share your data.
